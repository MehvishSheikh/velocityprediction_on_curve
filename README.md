## Velocity Prediction on a curve Using Computer vision


This project focuses on real-time road curvature and thereby predicting maximum velocity on curve. It also adds lane detection and road analysis autonomous driving applications. Leveraging computer vision techniques, it employs perspective transformations to create a bird's eye view of the road, facilitating accurate lane detection even in challenging conditions. The system utilizes a combination of color and gradient information to robustly identify lane markings, employing sliding window and polynomial fitting algorithms to track lane positions frame by frame. Road information such as velocity on curve, curvature, lane direction, and deviation from the center is computed and displayed in real-time, providing essential data for autonomous navigation.
